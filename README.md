Quadratic Formula
In algebra, a quadratic equation is an equation having the form:

ax*ax + bx + c = 0

Graphing the quadratic equation will create a parabola like the one below:

x = (-b +/- (b*b-4ac).squareRoot()) / 2*a

The corresponding x values are the x-intercepts of the graph, while a, b, and c are constants.
